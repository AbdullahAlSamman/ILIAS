# Roadmap

## Short Term

### Introduce Repository Pattern

Main db table access should be moved to repository classes.

### README

A README should introduce the main concepts.

Main Issues:
* Writing user skills: ilBasicSkill::writeUserSkillLevelStatus
* Using Skill UI: ilPersonalSkillsGUI();

### Deconstruct UI

* ilPersonalSkillsGUI should be deconstructed into smaller UI components.
